<<HEADING level=3>>6 Qualification of Welders<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of the welder qualification test is to determine the ability of welders to make sound butt or fillet welds
using previously qualified procedures. Before any production welding is performed, welders shall be qualified
according to the applicable requirements of 6.2 through 6.8. It is the intent of this standard that a welder who
satisfactorily completes the procedure qualification test is a qualified welder, provided the number of test specimens
required by 6.5 has been removed, tested, and meet the acceptance criteria of 5.6, for each welder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to starting the qualification tests, the welder shall be allowed reasonable time to adjust the welding equipment to
be used. The welder shall follow the requirements of the applicable qualified welding procedure specification. The
qualification of welders shall be conducted in the presence of a representative acceptable to the company.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A welder shall qualify for welding by performing a test on segments of pipe nipples or on full-size pipe nipples, as
specified in 6.2.1. When segments of pipe nipples are used, they shall be supported so that typical flat, vertical, and
overhead welds are produced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The essential variables associated with procedure and welder qualifications are not identical. The essential variables
for welder qualification are specified in 6.2.2 and 6.3.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Single Qualification<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For qualification to a single weld procedure specification, a welder shall make a test weld using a qualified procedure

<<PARAGRAPH>>Lineup clamps shall be used for butt welds in accordance with the welding procedure specification. When it is
permissible to remove the lineup clamp before the root bead is completed, the completed part of the bead shall be in
approximately equal segments spaced approximately equally around the circumference of the joint. However, when
an internal lineup clamp is used and conditions make it difficult to prevent movement of the pipe or if the weld will be
unduly stressed, the root bead shall be completed before clamp tension is released. Root bead segments used in
connection with external clamps should be uniformly spaced around the circumference of the pipe and shall have an

(13 mm) from the weld surface, at least three exposures separated by 120Â° shall be made for the radiographic testing of
a complete weld (DWE/SWV). When the radiographic source is outside and more than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm) from the weld
surface, at least four exposures separated by 90Â° shall be made for the radiographic testing of a complete weld (DWE/
SWV). When the OD of the piping containing the weld is 3.500 in. (88.9 mm) or less, a DWE/DWV procedure may be
used. When this procedure is used and the radiation beam is offset so that the source-side and film-side portions of the
weld do not overlap in the areas of the radiograph being evaluated, at least two exposures separated by 90Â° shall be
made for the radiographic testing of a complete weld. When the source-side and film-side portions of the weld are
superimposed, at least three exposures separated by 60Â° shall be made for the radiographic testing of a complete weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When smaller diameter, thicker wall pipe is radiographed, additional exposures should be made to minimize the
distortion of imperfection images at the ends of the radiographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For in-motion imaging, the exposure geometry shall be evaluated at the maximum scanning speed to be used during
the radiographic testing of the complete weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.4 Type of IQIs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IQIs shall conform to the requirements of either ASTM E747 or ISO 19232-1 wire IQI. The company shall define
which type of IQI (ASTM or ISO) is to be used. The IQI shall be made of a material that is radiographically similar to
the material being welded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.5 Selection of IQIs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The IQI shall consist of either a series of six (6) wires for ASTM E747 wire type or a series of seven (7) wires for ISO
19232-1 wire type IQI, arranged in order of increasing diameter. The essential wire diameter to be used, based on the
thickness of the weld is shown in Table 8 for ASTM E747 wire type IQI and Table 9 for ISO 19232-1 wire type IQI. At
the option of the company, smaller wire diameter IQI than those specified above may be used, provided the required
radiographic sensitivity is obtained. The radiographic images of the IQI identifying style number and ASTM set letter
or ISO designation shall appear clearly. The image of the essential wire diameter shall appear clearly across the
entire area of interest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   For purposes of IQI selection, when the SWE/SWV or DWE/SWV technique is used, the thickness of the weld means
specified wall thickness plus the weld reinforcement (internal plus external combined). When the "elliptical" DWE/DWV technique
is used, the thickness of the weld means twice the specified wall thickness plus the single weld reinforcement (internal plus
external combined). When the â€œsuperimposedâ€ DWE/DWV technique is used, the thickness of the weld means twice the specified
wall thickness plus twice the weld reinforcement (internal plus external combined).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.6 Placement of IQIs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.6.1 Film<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The IQIs shall be placed as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When a complete weld is radiographed in a single exposure using a source inside the piping, at least four IQIs
placed across the weld and spaced approximately equally around the circumference shall be used. For the DWE/
DWV procedure, one IQI shall be placed on the source side of the pipe and across the weld so that the essential
wire image is superimposed onto the weld images. For the DWE/SWV or SWE/SWV procedures requiring
multiple exposures or multiple films for complete inspection of the weld, and where the length of film to be
interpreted is greater than 5 in. (130 mm), two IQIs placed across the weld and located on the film side shall be
used. One shall be within 1 in. (25 mm) of the end of the film length to be interpreted and the other shall be at the
center of the film. When the film length to be interpreted is 5 in. (130 mm) or less, one IQI shall be placed on the
film side, across the weld and located at the center of the length to be interpreted. When a repaired weld is
radiographed, an additional IQI shall be placed across each repaired area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) When it is not practical to place an IQI on the weld due to weld configuration or size, the IQI may be placed on a
separate block. Separate blocks shall be made of the same or radiographically similar material and may be used
to facilitate IQI positioning. The thickness of the separate block material should be the same as the thickness of
the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Heat shieldsâ€”IQI may be placed on a heat shield rather than in contact with the pipe, provided that the
acceptability of such IQI placement is demonstrated during procedure qualification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.6.2 Other Imaging Media<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For imaging media other than film, IQI placement shall be the same as that required by 11.1.6.1. The IQI may be
placed above the surface of the pipe or held in position between the surface of the pipe and the imager by a fixture
attached to the imager or scanning device. Acceptability of such IQI placement shall be demonstrated during
procedure qualification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.7 Production Radiography<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Only Level II or III radiographers shall interpret the radiographic images of production welds. Radiographers shall
report to the company all defects observed in the images unless the company requires that all imperfections observed
be reported. The radiographer shall indicate whether the weld meets the requirements of Section 9. The company
shall determine the final disposition of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAance limits for imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is usually impractical to qualify individual pipeline welds for the alternative acceptance limits after a defect under
Section 9 is detected, because destructive testing is required to establish the required mechanical properties for the
welding procedure under consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex provides procedures to determine the maximum allowable imperfection sizes. It does not prevent the use
of Section 9 for determining imperfection acceptance limits for any weld. Use of this annex is completely at the
companyâ€™s option.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this annex, the use of the phrase imperfection acceptance limits and other phrases containing the word
imperfection is not intended to imply a defective condition or any lack of weld integrity. All welds contain certain
features variously described as artifacts, imperfections, discontinuities, or flaws. These terms are widely accepted
and used interchangeably. The primary purpose of this annex is to define, on the basis of a technical analysis, the
effect of various types, sizes, and shapes of such anomalies on the suitability of the whole weld for a specific service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<n strong hydroxides, nitrates, or carbonates. When these materials are present
inside the pipe, a minimum threshold stress shall be established, and this annex shall not be used if the calculated stress
exceeds the threshold value. With respect to H 2 S service, the definition of such service shall be that given in
NACE MR0175. Although external exposure to carbonates and nitrates in the soil has been shown to produce stress
corrosion cracking (SCC) in a small number of cases, the cracking is normally axial and is associated with
circumferential stress rather than axial stress. However, circumferential SCC failures may occur at locations where
longitudinal stresses have increased over the life of the pipeline, for example, at overbends above unstable slopes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency and severity of SCC can be mitigated by the use of proper coating and proper cathodic protection. The
use of this annex is not precluded when direct exposure to the aggressive environment is prevented by a coating
designed to resist the environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2.4 Dynamic Loading<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The stress analysis shall include consideration of potential dynamic loading on girth welds, such as loads from
closure of check valves. This annex does not apply to welds strained at a strain rate greater than 10 â€“3  second (a
stress rate of 30 ksi/sec for steel).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11  The implied safety factor in the fatigue spectrum severity limit for Options 1 and 2 varies, depending on, for example, the pipe
wall thickness and distribution of fatigue spectrum. For a wide range of onshore and offshore pipeline scenarios, the spectrum
severity limit is estimated to provide a safety factor of more than 2 or 5 on cycles when the fatigue growth rates are based on
mean+2 standard deviation or mean values of BS 7910 (Table 4,  R  > 0.5), respectively.
12  Options 1 and 2 provide an adequate safety factor against fracture due to moderate cyclic loading provided aforementioned
â€œsteel-in-airâ€ curve is applicable. In other environments, for example, when determining allowable defect sizes at the OD of an
offshore pipeline with fusion-bonded epoxy field joint coating and under cathodic protection, use of the â€œsteel-in-airâ€ curve is not
appropriate and use of Option 1 or 2 may not be sufficiently conservative. Similarly, if cyclic loading exceeds the defined
spectrum severity of 5 Ã— 10 6 , for example, due to cyclic stresses from offshore installation loads on a pipe lay stinger, use of
Option 1 or 2 may also not be sufficiently conservative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.2.5 Residual Stress<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The effects of welding residual stress are accounted for by specifying minimum CTOD toughness and Charpy energy
and by incorporating appropriate safety factor in Options 1 and 2 procedures (A.5.1.3 and A.5.1.4). The determination
of residual stress is not required under these conditions. The effects of residual stress shall be evaluated for all time-
dependent failure mechanisms, such as fatigue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3 Welding Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The controls of the variables necessary to ensure an acceptable level of fracture toughness in a welding procedure
are more stringent than those controlling welding procedures without minimum toughness requirements. An
appropriate quality control program shall be established to ensure welding is performed within the parameters of the
qualified welding procedure. Qualification of welding procedures to be used with this annex shall be in accordance
with Section 5 or Section 12 of this standard, with the additional mechanical property testing in accordance with A.3.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.2 Essential Variables<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any change in the essential variables specified below shall require requalification of the welding procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) A change in the welding process, mode of arc transfer, or method of application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A change in any of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For procedures intended to overcome the effect of heat removal by the flowing contents by using a sufficiently high
heat input level  22  (heat input control procedures), the required heat input range should be specified. For procedures
intended to overcome the effect of heat removal by the flowing contents by using temper bead deposition sequence
(temper bead procedures), the required heat input range for each layer should be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.2.1.4 Weld Deposition Sequence<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For procedures intended to overcome the effect of heat removal by the flowing contents by using temper bead
deposition sequence (temper bead procedures), the required weld deposition sequence should be specified. The weld
deposition sequence should include tolerances for bead spacing to assure proper tempering of the previous passes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For in-service fillet welds, SMYS is not an essential variable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   For in-service welds other than fillet welds, the strength of the completed weld meets or exceeds the specified minimum
strength of the pipe and fitting material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An increase in the carbon equivalent above that of the material used for procedure qualification constitutes an
essential variable, except as provided below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A procedure may be used for higher carbon equivalent materials than the material used for procedure qualification
provided that the thermal conditions are less severe than the procedure qualification conditions and no increase in the
risk of hydrogen cracking results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.3.1.2 Pipeline Operating Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For in-service welds, an increase in the severity of the pipeline operating conditions (in terms of weld cooling rates)
above the group qualified constitutes an essential variable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.3.1.3 Pipe Wall Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For in-service fillet welds, wall thickness is not an essential variable. However, wall thickness of the materials being
welded should be considered when considering the thermal severity of the pipeline operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   For weld deposition repairs, the qualified welding procedure is not used on a remaining pipe wall thickness less than
what was used during qualification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.3.1.4 Weld Deposition Sequence<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A change from a deposition sequence that relies on tempering to some other deposition sequence constitutes an
essential variable. For a deposition sequence that relies on tempering, a change in the bead spacing beyond the
limits in the welding procedure specification constitutes an essential variable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.4.3 Weld Deposition Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Weld deposition repairs should be deposited on a section of pipe containing simulated wall loss. The area of
simulated wall loss should be of sufficient size to remove all the required tests specimens and may consist of a single
larger area or multiple smaller areas (see B.2.5.1). Other specimen layouts may be used at the discretion of the
company. The remaining wall thickness of the simulated wall loss should be no greater than the minimum value
specified in the welding procedure specification. Weld deposition repairs should be deposited in such a way that the
original wall thickness is completely restored.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B.3 In-service Welder Qualification<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For in-service welding, the welder should be qualified to apply the specific procedure being used according to the
requirements of 6.2, except for the alternative/additional requirements specified in this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A welder qualified on pipe having an OD of less than 12.750 in. (323.9 mm) should be qualified for all diameters less
than or equal to the diameter used in the qualification test. A welder qualified on pipe having an OD of greater than or
equal to 12.750 in. (323.9 mm) should be qualified for all pipe diameters. A welder who has an existing multiple
qualification to 6.3 and an in-service qualification to B.3 should be qualified as an in-service branch or sleeve welder
for all positions, all diameters, and all wall thicknesses within the limits of the essential variables in 6.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For weld deposition repairs, welders who perform test welds on the bottom of the pipe are qualified for welding in all
positions. Welders who perform test welds on the side of the pipe are qualified for welding only on the side and top of
the pipe. Welders who perform test welds on the top of the pipe are qualified for welding only on the top of the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.2 Welding of Test Joint<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For in-service welding, pipeline operating conditions that affect the ability of the flowing contents to remove heat from
the pipe wall should be simulated while test joints are being made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(e.g. motor oil) may be used to simulate less severe thermal conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to making the test joint used for the destructive testing described in B.3.3, the welder should demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the company the ability to comply with aspects of the welding procedure specification that are
intended to avoid the development of crack-susceptible microstructures and/or prevention of burn-through. For
example, for heat input control procedures, the company may choose to require the welder to demonstrate the ability
to maintain a heat input level within the range specified in the welding procedure specification. For temper bead and
weld deposition repair procedures, the company may choose to require the welder to demonstrate bead placement
within the dimensional tolerances specified in the welding procedure specification and the ability to maintain a heat
input level within the range specified in the welding procedure specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.3 Testing of Welded Joints<<HEADING_END>>
